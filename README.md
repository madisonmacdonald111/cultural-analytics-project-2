# Mini Project 2: Marvel Universe Social Network
**INFO 230 | Spring 2026**

---

## Overview

Can the structure of a comic book universe reveal sixty years of editorial decisions? This project applies a full network analysis pipeline to the [Marvel Universe Social Network](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network) from Kaggle (a dataset of 6,439 heroes and 96,104 co-appearances across 12,651 comic issues).

For the full analysis, results, discussion, and interpretations see **`code/project-workflow.ipynb`**.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `nodes.csv` | All 19,090 nodes with type label (hero or comic) |
| `edges.csv` | Raw two-sided network — one row per hero-comic appearance |
| `hero-network.csv` | Pre-projected hero-to-hero co-appearance network |

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Create and activate the conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate cultural_analytics
```
3. Launch Jupyter and run `code/project-workflow.ipynb` top to bottom

All random operations use `SEED = 230` so results are fully reproducible.

---

## Environment

All dependencies are managed via `environment.yaml` using the `cultural_analytics` conda environment. Key packages include `scipy`, `networkx`, `pyvis`, and `plotly` for network analysis and visualization, alongside `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` for general data processing.

## AI Disclosure

Claude (Anthropic) was used as an AI assistant throughout this project for help with code structure, debugging, implementation decisions, and writing feedback. All code was read through, understood, and retyped manually. All analytical decisions, interpretations, and conclusions are my own. Claude helped, but the thinking was mine.
